# Claude Code Memory

## Development Guidelines

1. **Occam's Razor** - Keep code minimal while maintaining quality
2. **Engineering First** - Every change should improve overall project structure
3. **Zero Redundancy** - No redundant code allowed
4. **Fix Root Cause** - Never patch over problems, always solve at the root
5. **File Size** - Keep files under 500 lines
6. **Import Style** - Use absolute imports for cross-package (`liveweb_arena.core.xxx`), relative for same package
7. **Commit Rules** - Only commit when explicitly asked; keep messages concise
8. **Template Testing** - Every new question template must be tested via `eval.py` with multiple seeds to verify the entire evaluation pipeline works correctly

## Template Design Guidelines

**Core Principle**: Templates must test real web interaction ability, NOT memorization.

### 1. Anti-Memorization Design

Fixed question pool + fixed answers = memorizable. Models can "cheat" by recalling Q&A pairs from training data without actually browsing.

**Design strategies to prevent memorization:**
- **Dynamic data**: Answers that change over time (e.g., counts that grow as new content is added)
- **Computation required**: Aggregation, comparison, or calculation that cannot be pre-memorized
- **Obscure queries**: Information rarely covered in training data (e.g., 7th billed actor vs lead actor)
- **Large entity pools**: Combinatorial space too large to enumerate all possible Q&A pairs

**Risk assessment**: Prefer templates where answers are dynamic or require real-time computation. Avoid templates with small fixed entity sets and static attributes.

### 2. Verifiability

- Every question must have a clear path: Template -> API endpoint -> Ground truth
- API response and website display must share the same data source
- Validation tolerance accounts for timing-related differences (data may change between agent browsing and ground truth fetch) and format variations, not for agent capability errors

### 3. Solvability

- Target website must be publicly accessible without authentication
- Required information must be visible on the page
- Expected steps should be minimal for theoretical completion, with reasonable buffer (not extremely tight limits)

### 4. Difficulty Stratification

- **Easy**: Single-hop, direct URL navigation, one data point extraction
- **Medium**: Search required, or multiple data points from same page
- **Hard**: Multi-page navigation, cross-reference, or aggregation across multiple sources

    Template for 7-day price performance queries - HIGH DIFFICULTY, MULTI-STEP.

    Uses 7-day data because CoinGecko webpage shows signed percentages in
    descriptive text for 7d (e.g., "With a price decline of -18.30% in the last 7 days").
    30-day data only shows unsigned values in the table, making sign detection unreliable.

    Requires multi-step navigation:
    - Single coin: Navigate to coin page, find 7d performance data
    - Comparison: Navigate to both coins and compare their 7d changes

    Examples:
    - How much has Bitcoin's price changed in the last 7 days?
    - Which performed better over the last week: Ethereum or Solana?

"""Multi-condition filter template for Hacker News - HARD DIFFICULTY

RL-friendly design:
- Requires visiting multiple story detail pages to get comment counts
- Requires checking TWO conditions simultaneously (cannot sort single column)
- Large exploration space: different strategies for scanning stories
- Dynamic data: comment counts change frequently
- Combinatorial question space: threshold combinations prevent memorization

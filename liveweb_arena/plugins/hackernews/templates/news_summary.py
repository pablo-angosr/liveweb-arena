"""HackerNews news summary template - MEDIUM-HARD difficulty

RL-friendly design:
- Tests dual abilities: information extraction + summarization
- Variable story counts (3, 5, 7, 10) prevent memorization
- LLM-based validation with structured scoring rubric
- Requires understanding content, not just copying text
- Multiple summary types add variation

Evaluation dimensions:
- Story coverage (40%): Agent mentions all required stories
- Topic accuracy (30%): Descriptions reflect actual content
- Factual accuracy (20%): Numbers (score/comments) approximately correct
- Organization (10%): Clear, readable structure
